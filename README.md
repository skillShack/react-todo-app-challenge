# React To Do App

## Introduction

A to-do list is a simple application that stores a list of user added tasks, that can be added and deleted as new tasks come in or are completed. This is a simple idea which is easy to build but will allow one to explore a variety of concepts from schedulers, push notifications, cloud storage etc.

## Requirements

The below set of requirements are considered to be the bare-minimum for an application to be considered a `to-do app`.

- A simple form to add new tasks (todos).
- A centralised list of all task that have been added.
- The ability to delete a task upon completion.
- The ability to edit a task.

### Some ideas ðŸ’¡

- User Authentication (Social Auth or Simple Email/Phone number authentication).
- Ability to reorder tasks in the main list.
- Support for deadlines.
- Cloud Storage to persist data and sync it across devices.

## Suggestions

- Use `localStorage` to persist user data across multiple visits.
